# Analysis Statement

## Conceptualization
### What opportunity or issue is the site addressing? 
I'm iterating on my portfolio website that I created in project and portfolio 3. I want to change up my site becuase I feel like I can make the site more advance becuase of what I learned since the time when I made this.
### What is the motivation for the site? 
The motivation for this site is coming from the fact that, I've learned many new skills and I want to use them to make the site better than it already is. 
### What is it's purpose? 
The site's purpose is to display all my work that i've done in the past. Including assignments, personal projects, freelance work, etc.. 
### What sort of content or feature requirements are required? 
On my prevoius site I used HTML, CSS, MYSQL, PHP, and JS. On this new site I will be using HTML, SASS, jQuery/JS.

### Content Requirements
About, Skills, Projects, and Contact page. Icon Gallery, contact form, skills progress bar. I will use 3 colors blue, red, white, and white & black font color. The photo I will be using is Roboto. The photos I will be using on this site will range from photos of recent projects to a video demostrating the website.

### Functionality Requirements
This site will allow the user to view my projects, skills, and a biography from myself. The user will be able to navagate to different sections on my site. The different sections are the ones I just listed. 

### Review Your Competitors' Sites/Apps
My competitors will be my peers portfolio site. Also some compeitors will be other people in the web design & development field. Anyone that has a portfolio site wether they have a top ranked site or not.

### Estimate Costs. 
Currently the only cost I have right now is for my digital ocean account. $10 a month for my server on digital ocean. Also my domain demetriusberkeley.info has expired so I will have to purchase a new domain on either google domains or amazon web services.
